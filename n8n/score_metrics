## KPI classification logic

Providers are categorized each evaluation period (weekly) based on KPI thresholds derived from the performance bands above.  
These labels are used by downstream automation to trigger alerts, summaries, and provider outreach workflows.

### Classification categories

| Category | Description |
|---|---|
| **TOP PERFORMER** | Consistently exceeds performance expectations |
| **WATCH** | Metrics are within acceptable range but trending negatively |
| **NEEDS INTERVENTION** | Performance falls below acceptable thresholds and requires ops follow-up |

### KPI thresholds (weekly evaluation)

A provider is classified using the following rules:

#### 🟢 TOP PERFORMER
All of the following must be true:
- Avg response time **≤ 10 minutes**
- Appointment completion rate **≥ 95%**
- Avg patient satisfaction **≥ 4.6**
- Minimum appointment volume threshold met (to avoid low-sample bias)

#### 🟡 WATCH
Any of the following conditions:
- Avg response time **10–20 minutes**
- Completion rate **88–94%**
- Satisfaction **4.2–4.5**
- Negative week-over-week trend in **any** KPI (even if still within acceptable range)

WATCH status is intended to surface early signals before performance degrades further.

#### 🔴 NEEDS INTERVENTION
Any of the following conditions:
- Avg response time **> 20 minutes**
- Completion rate **< 88%**
- Satisfaction **< 4.2**
- Sustained negative trend across **2+ weeks**

This category triggers provider outreach and operational follow-up workflows.

### Trend detection logic

Trends are evaluated week-over-week using percentage or absolute deltas:

- **Response time:** ≥ +20% increase week-over-week
- **Completion rate:** ≥ −5 percentage point drop
- **Satisfaction:** ≥ −0.3 rating drop

Trend signals can escalate a provider to **WATCH** or **NEEDS INTERVENTION** even if absolute thresholds are not yet crossed.

### Operational notes
- Classification is recalculated weekly using rolling 7-day or calendar-week windows.
- Providers with very low appointment volume may be excluded or flagged for manual review.
- Thresholds are configurable and stored separately from SQL logic to reflect real-world ops flexibility.

This classification framework allows the system to move beyond reporting and actively support clinical operations decision-making.
